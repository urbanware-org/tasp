## Definition

The *TaSp* project consists of two simple components to replace tabs with spaces (or vice versa) for a consistent indentation method inside files and also to consistently indent messed up files.

[Top](#tasp-)

## Details

When many different people work on the same text, config or code file, the indentation inside sometimes gets messed up because some people did not follow the instructions and different text editors with different indentation settings (spaces or tabs) were used.

Depending on the preferences set up in the text editors, these will represent the tabs differently on the screen.

For example, a user who prefers a tab with the width of eight spaces and which is saved as tab character creates a file. When another user who prefers a tab with the width of four spaces opens that file, the indentation may look messed up to him.

Some people prefer saving tabs as spaces. Instead of saving tabs with the tab character, the tab will be saved with a user-defined amount of spaces (e. g. four spaces for one tab). So, no matter what the preferred tab width is, the indentation looks identical in every text editor.

Every user has his own preferences or specifications what type of indentation to use. To avoid a complete mess, tab and space indentations basically should not get mixed inside a file. Depending on the amount and size of the files, manually adjusting the used indentations sometimes takes quite some time.

For consistent indentation *TaSp* provides two simple components. Further information can be found inside the [wiki](https://github.com/urbanware-org/tasp/wiki).

On April 2018 the project has officially been discontinued. Details can be found [here](https://github.com/urbanware-org/tasp/wiki#end-of-life).

## Requirements

In order to run *TaSp*, the *Python* framework must be installed on the system.

Depending on which version of the framework you are using:

*   *Python* 2.x (version 2.7 or higher is recommended, may also work with earlier versions)
*   *Python* 3.x (version 3.2 or higher is recommended, may also work with earlier versions)

## Documentation

Inside the `docs` sub-directories there are plain text files containing the documentation for each component with further information and usage examples.

## Contact

As mentioned above, this project has been discontinued. For this reason, no new features will be implemented, existing features will not be enhanced and remaining bugs will not be fixed either.

However, if you have questions about it, you can contact me by sending an email to <dev@urbanware.org>.
